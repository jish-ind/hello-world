# hello-world
Hello world, I am 10 years old and I am new to GitHub.I am very curious and I would like to find, edit and upload different files.
I have lots of questions that I am sure you guys could answer.
What is GitHub used for and why?
What can you make with Gits?
Please post answers in the comments(if there is one).
